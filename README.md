# Module-19-Challenge-Cryptocurrency-Wallet
Challenge: Cryptocurrency Wallet- In this Challenge, we will assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer in order to do the following:

### * Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase
### (which you created earlier in the module).

### * Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account
### address.

### * Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas
### estimate, that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate for their work.

### * Digitally sign a transaction that pays a KryptoJobs2Go candidate, and send
### this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

### * Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

### Once you receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions
### section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that
### you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the
### README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.
